# EKG DOCS

## Preface

EKG docs contains tutorial about the EKG standard way to creating GUIs and the fundamentals of EKG model-architecture.

## Programming GUIs with EKG

* What is EKG?]
* Setup
* Hello-World
* EKG-standard

## EKG Technical Details

Complete details about importants EKG technologies, this section includes: the root problem of legacy EKG, memory-handling model architecture, safety-proofs, package pattern, descriptors-model, standard format for input-binding(s) and more.

This topic is important for contributing to EKG, so, should be caeful read before sending ~useless~ pull requests. As everything here on Vokegpu, take a read on [Vokegpu standard](https://github.com/vokegpu/standard).
