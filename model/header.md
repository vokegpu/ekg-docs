# Architecture Model

As known for creating GUI at user-programmer side is currently complex and old, to change it, we will discuss here.

### EKG has big plans for now üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

#### The problem

I was looking the code for create widgets and I noticed one thing, I mean, is not hard to notice that; the GUI creation method is horrible.

You can stack widgets inside a frame/container bla-bla.
```c++
ekg::frame("meow", {.x = 0.0f, .y = 0.0f, .w = 200.0f}, ekg::dock::none);
ekg::label("Meow!", ekg::dock::fill);
ekg::button("Meow Here", ekg::dock::fill | ekg::dock::next);
```

And voala we have this simple GUI frame.  
[splash-meow-gui](../splash/splash-meow.gui.png?raw=true)

I do not think it is a simple-easy way to create GUIs, increasing the complexity make worse to create. So the point is not rewrite all the entire library but only focus on the important parts, the user-programmer side.

#### User-programmer side

`User-programmer` means you, the one who use the EKG library, so you are called user-programmer, for almost 3 years I did not even think about you, I was only focusing on the runtime and widgets. Because of this, some stupids decisions was made for EKG, like the part of creating widgets.

May you think, how we can improve it? And the anwser is:  
NO MORE useless OO (Object-Oriented) features.

One obvious feature, the user-programmer interface with 3 layers concept:  
-- user-programmer  
-- ui-object  
-- widget-object  

When a widget is created, the user-programmer only has access to the ui-object, then the runtime internally generate from ui-object a widget, linked to this ui-object.

The point obvious here:  
-- Why [OO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is used here?   
-- Why is there lot of bloat setters/getters?

#### Answering all these questions

Normally a GUI runtime OO-based have naturally overheads, there is no problem, like we need focus on the algorithm and not only in [branchless programming](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branchless/). EKG created the UI-object concept, if the user-programmer created an element, user-programmer only has acess to the UI-object, a simple rule, but bloated.

```c++
class abstract {
protected:
    ekg::id id {}; // like wtf
public:
    popup *do_some_stupid_thing();
    popup *do_meows();
    popup *bla_bla_setts();
    bla_t getters_bla();
};
```

If we want create a new element like a popup, we must create a class based from the `ekg::ui::abstract`.

```c++
class popup : public ekg::ui::abstract {
protected:
    int32_t wtf_number_for_something {};
public:
    popup *may_we_boom();
}
```

Doing like this way, is extremly bloated. The user-programmer side projection is actually worse.  

```c++
ekg::frame("meow", {.x = 0.0f, .y = 0.0f, .w = 200.0f}, ekg::dock::none)
    ->set_drag(ekg::dock::top)
    ->set_resize(ekg::dock::left | ekg::dock::bottom | ekg::dock::right)
    ->lol_really_builder_pattern("?");
```

UI-object concept needs many getters/setters, this was a stupid decision made in the past, Rina, why did you made this? God.

Getters/setters is a cool way to improve security, but sometimes there is no reason for getters/setters. Like why a setter for set the frame dimensions? just no. EKG must re-write this part and write a new model pattern.

#### Descriptors

Vulkan, DirectX 11/12, system libraries, wayland-clients (compositors), and more others technologies implements the object-state descriptors.

Now EKG must follow this way too, also as necessary for a better GPU-API(s) standard compatibility.  
EKG already implemented descriptors for samplers objects. Lets look better.

```c++
uint32_t previous_size {f_renderer.font_size};
f_renderer.set_size(512);

FT_Load_Char(
  typography_font_face.ft_face,
  ekg::utf_string_to_char32("üêÆ"),
  FT_LOAD_RENDER | FT_LOAD_COLOR | FT_LOAD_DEFAULT
);

f_renderer.set_size(previous_size);

sampler_alloc_info.w = static_cast<int32_t>(typography_font_face.ft_face->glyph->bitmap.width);
sampler_alloc_info.h = static_cast<int32_t>(typography_font_face.ft_face->glyph->bitmap.rows);

sampler_alloc_info.gl_wrap_modes[0] = GL_REPEAT;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_wrap_modes[1] = GL_REPEAT;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_parameter_filter[0] = GL_LINEAR;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_parameter_filter[1] = GL_LINEAR;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_internal_format = GL_RGBA;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_format = GL_BGRA;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_type = GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_generate_mipmap = GL_TRUE;
sampler_alloc_info.p_data = typography_font_face.ft_face->glyph->bitmap.buffer;

return ekg::allocate_sampler(
  &sampler_alloc_info,
  p_sampler
);
```

Cool ya?
