# Architecture-Model

## Preface

As known for creating GUI at user-programmer side is currently complex and old, to change it, we will discuss here.

EKG is a significant project of my life, I wasted lot of time coding EKG, but it is what I love to do, graphics, GUIs, and GPU-accelerated softwares.

Many years coding EKG I made a lot of mistakes decisions and now after 3 years, I need to think better about my library. I am alone in this journey, but I believe we need sometimes do two-steps backward and re-write, re-do, re-think the architecture of us projects.

## The Problem

#### Status-Quo

I was reading the code for create widgets and I noticed one thing, I mean, is not hard to notice that; the GUI creation method is horrible.

You can stack widgets inside a frame/container bla-bla.
```cpp
ekg::frame("meow", {.x = 0.0f, .y = 0.0f, .w = 200.0f}, ekg::dock::none);
ekg::label("Meow!", ekg::dock::fill);
ekg::button("Meow Here", ekg::dock::fill | ekg::dock::next);
```

And voila we have this simple GUI frame.  
![splash-meow-gui](../splash/splash-meow-gui.png?raw=true)

I do not think it is a simple-easy way to create GUIs, imagine increasing the complexity of GUI context, a lot of worse code to just create GUI. So the point is not rewrite all the entire library but only focus on the important parts, the user-programmer side.

#### User-Programmer Side

`User-programmer` means you, the one who use the EKG library, so you are called user-programmer, for almost 3 years I did not even think about you, I was only focusing on the runtime and widgets. Because of this, some stupids decisions were made for EKG, like the part of creating widgets.

May you think, how we can improve it? And the anwser is:  
NO useless [OO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (Object-Oriented) features.

3 things:  
-- user-programmer  
-- ui-object  
-- widget-object  

When a widget is created, the user-programmer only has access to the ui-object, then the runtime internally generate from ui-object a widget, linked to this ui-object.

The point obvious here:  
-- Why [OO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is used here?   
-- Why are there lot of bloat setters/getters?

#### Answering All These Questions

Normally a GUI runtime [OO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)-based have naturally overheads, there is no problem, like we need focus on the algorithm and not only in [branchless programming](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/branchless/). EKG created the UI-object concept, if the user-programmer created an element, user-programmer only has access to the UI-object, a simple rule, but bloated.

```cpp
class abstract {
protected:
  ekg::id_t id {}; // like wtf
public:
  abstract *do_some_stupid_thing();
  abstract *do_meows();
  abstract *bla_bla_setts();
  bla_t getters_bla();
};
```

If we want create a new element like a popup, we must create a class based from the `ekg::ui::abstract`.

```cpp
class popup : public ekg::ui::abstract {
protected:
  int32_t wtf_number_for_something {};
public:
  popup *may_we_boom();
}
```

And an abstract widget:
```cpp
class popup_widget : public ekg::ui::abstract_widget {
public: // always public
  // internal reserved case fields
public:
  // virtuals method(s)
}
```

Doing like this way, is extremly bloated. The user-programmer side projection is actually worse.  

```cpp
ekg::frame("meow", {.x = 0.0f, .y = 0.0f, .w = 200.0f}, ekg::dock::none)
  ->set_drag(ekg::dock::top)
  ->set_resize(ekg::dock::left | ekg::dock::bottom | ekg::dock::right)
  ->lol_really_builder_pattern("?");
```

UI-object concept needs many getters/setters, this was a stupid decision made in the past, Rina, why did you made this? God.

Getters/setters is a cool way to improve security, but sometimes there is no reason for getters/setters. Like why a setter for set the frame dimensions? just no. EKG must re-write this part and write a new model pattern.

#### Descriptors

Vulkan, DirectX 11/12, system libraries, wayland-clients (compositors), and more others technologies implements the object-state descriptors.

Now EKG must follow this way too, also as necessary for a better between GPU-API(s) standard compatibility.  
EKG already implemented descriptors for samplers objects. Lets look better.

```cpp
uint32_t previous_size {f_renderer.font_size};
f_renderer.set_size(512);

FT_Load_Char(
  typography_font_face.ft_face,
  ekg::utf_string_to_char32("üêÆ"),
  FT_LOAD_RENDER | FT_LOAD_COLOR | FT_LOAD_DEFAULT
);

f_renderer.set_size(previous_size);

sampler_alloc_info.w = static_cast<int32_t>(typography_font_face.ft_face->glyph->bitmap.width);
sampler_alloc_info.h = static_cast<int32_t>(typography_font_face.ft_face->glyph->bitmap.rows);

sampler_alloc_info.gl_wrap_modes[0] = GL_REPEAT;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_wrap_modes[1] = GL_REPEAT;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_parameter_filter[0] = GL_LINEAR;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_parameter_filter[1] = GL_LINEAR;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_internal_format = GL_RGBA;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_format = GL_BGRA;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_type = GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE;
sampler_alloc_info.gl_generate_mipmap = GL_TRUE;
sampler_alloc_info.p_data = typography_font_face.ft_face->glyph->bitmap.buffer;

return ekg::allocate_sampler(
  &sampler_alloc_info,
  p_sampler
);
```

Cool?

## The Solution

Today most of programmers do not want to hardcode or write large codes for small output(s), so imagine a large bloated code to output graphical user interface, a mess.

The C++ std version used in EKG is 17, but EKG does not even implement any of features, rarely `constexpr` or new `std::` features; may you find only `std::string_view`, which you can think okay, we do not need to be forced to use alternative ways, as example, you can have a macro instead the use of `template`:

```cpp
#define ekg_lerp(a, b, t) a + (b - a) * t

namespace ekg {
  template<typename t>
  constexpr t lerp(t a, t b, t delta) {
    return a + (b - a) * delta;
  }
}

// both are the same, so any-way

ekg_lerp(1.0f, 2.0f, 0.5); // 1.5f
ekg::lerp<float>(1.0f, 2.0f, 0.5); // 1.5f
```

If we can macro for these operations, why we need C++17 then?

At sametime we have consistency of macro but we have a bad image for the community, "hey you must use `insert-modern-cpp-features`". Now, I will think better, instead making confuses decisions.

#### Design

Now we must take all the previous knowneldge and implement for the user-programmer widget creation.

Descriptors for create each UI element, descriptors for options, descriptors for details, descriptors for internal functions, descriptors for themes, and all descriptors for user-programmer application-side-input(s).

```cpp
bool do_something {};

ekg::make<ekg::frame_t>(
  { 
    .tag = "idk a frame?",
    .options = {
    .rect = {.w = 50.0f, .h = 50.0f},
    .resize = ekg::dock::none,
    .drag = ekg::dock::full
  }
);

ekg::make<ekg::label_t>(
  {
    .tag = "idk meow?",
    .text = "tijolo",
    .dock = ekg::dock::fill,
    .options = {
    .text_dock = ekg::dock::left
  }
);


ekg::make<ekg::checkbox_t>(
  {
    .tag = "idk ?<>?<>?>> meow?",
    .text = "click here if u brain",
    .value = ekg::value<bool>(&do_something),
    .text = {
      .value =
    }
    .options = {
      .text_dock = ekg::dock::left,
      .
    }
  }
);

```

And voila^2, new protype model. But it keeps bloated, how can we simplify this?

Well we can, here is:

```cpp
ekg::checkbox_t check {
  /* add stuff */
};

ekg::make(check);

check.text = "bla";
ekg::make(bla);

bla.text = "boo";
```

#### Benefits

Now some benefits we gain with this new model:

* Memory-safe descriptors:  
  | - | Recyclable descriptors with many possible designs.  
  | - | Easily by-widget theme and many options settings.  
  | - | No raw-ptr(s) or smart-ptr(s) for descriptors. As proven [here](./proofs#Raw-Pointers-Unsafety), it is too dangerous for an interface context.

* Stack-system for better query performance and widgets internal-logic.

## Runtime

### Model Fundamentals

This applies to the descriptors, not the renderable widgets. Until descriptors memory-model are done, internal EKG systems will not implement pools for renderable widgets.

The argument is:
> If usage of pointers are potentially unsafe, pointers must be not used, instead, a memory pool must be used.

### C++-Style Reference

When executing programs in a OS, the memory accessed from the program is not directly the RAM, but a virtual place, reference is a pointer that points to the virtual place of something.

There is two ways to describing a reference in C++:  
  | - | C-style: `meow_t *p`.  
  | - | C++-style: `meow_t &v`.  

Both C and C are the same, as shown:
```cpp
void meow(int *p_meow) {
  *p_meow = 40;
}

void meow(int &meow) {
  meow = 40;
}

// x86-64 gcc 14.2
meow(int*):
  push rbp
  mov  rbp, rsp
  mov  QWORD PTR [rbp-8], rdi
  mov  rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-8]
  mov  DWORD PTR [rax], 40
  nop
  pop  rbp
  ret
meow(int&):
  push rbp
  mov  rbp, rsp
  mov  QWORD PTR [rbp-8], rdi
  mov  rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-8]
  mov  DWORD PTR [rax], 40
  nop
  pop  rbp
  ret
```

C-style reference is complete dangerous in most of cases, requires strictly validations and memory-handling, if not, undefined behaviors occurs and there is no way to eficiently work on it.

```cpp
struct meow_t {
public:
  bool was_created {};
};

ekg::flags_t create(meow_t *p_meow) {
  if (p_meow == nullptr) { // validation needed;
    // BUT it does not save you from your own mistakes: UNDETECTED DELETED MEMORY
    return ekg::result::failed;
  }

  p_meow->was_created = true; // <- sign that was created
  return ekg::result::success;
}
```

Of course, we can do that, but nothing prevents you from any programming mistakes, handling memory in this way is hard, now imagine it totally safe, it is impossible to set `nullptr` automatically all the time.

```cpp
meow_t meow {};
create(&meow); // ok, created

meow_t *p_meow {new meow_t {}};
created(p_meow); // hm dangerous but ok, created

delete p_meow;
p_meow = nullptr; // (?) wha, how could you explicit set as nullptr always?
create(p_meow); // (??)

delete p_meow;
create(p_meow); // (??) hbasjdhsbjhbdjh Biwbeihd

// etc

meow_t a {};
meow_t b { .p_meow = &a }; // (?) this is horrible

```

Unlike this, C++ reference allow compile-time type-safe programming, so, no mistakes occur, because you are building with known types.

```cpp
std::vector<meow_t> meows(2);
meow_t &meow {meows.at(0)}; // safe
meow.text = "must meow?";

{
  meow_t &humm_meow {meows.at(0)};
  humm_meow.text = "yes";

  meow_t &second_meow {meows.at(1)};
  second_meow.text = humm_meow.text;
}

meows.clear();

if (!meows.empty()) {
  // do here, safe
}
```

May you think, of course, it is safe, so, this is the way for handling descriptors in EKG.

### Pool

A memory pool is a space where `n` size of memory block is reserved (dynamic or not), and occuped when neeeds. This block of memory is index-based, so picking descriptors from the pool require a known index. Allowing branch prediction.

Pool is defined as:
```cpp
// ekg/io/memory.hpp

#include <vector>

namespace ekg {
  template<typename t>
  using pool = std::vector<t>;
}
```

For defining how map-indices from a pool:
```cpp
// ekg/io/memory.hpp

#include <cstdint>

namespace ekg {
  typedef uint64_t id_t;
  typedef uint64_t flags_t;

  struct at_t {
  public:
    ekg::flags_t type {};
    ekg::id_t id {};
    size_t index {};
  };
}
```

When defining the descriptor, an empty-case must be defined, where point to a safety controlled not-found behavior.

```cpp
struct meow_t {
public:
  static meow_t not_found { .is_error_reserved = true };
public:
  bool is_error_reserved {};
  ekg::at_t at_next {};
public:
  bool operator == (ekg::meow_t &other) {
    return this->is_error_reserved == other.is_error_reserved;
  }

  bool operator != (ekg::meow_t &other) {
    return this->is_error_reserved != other.is_error_reserved;
  }
};
```

With this descriptor-base done, we need now query it, and safety say if it was found or not.

```cpp
meow_t &query(ekg::at_t at, ekg::pool<meow_t> &pool) {
  return at.index >= pool.size() ? meow_t::not_found : pool.at(index);
}
```

This pool system is totally safe, no raw-ptr, no any kinda of smart-ptr to "prevent" memory issues.

```cpp
ekg::pool<meow_t> meow_pool {};
meow_pool.emplace_back();
meow_t &a {meow_pool.at(0)};

meow_pool.emplace_back();
meow_t &b {meow_pool.at(1)};
b.at_next.index = 0;

meow_t &search_meow {query({.index = 3654}, meow_pool)};
if (search_meow == ekg::meow_t::not_found) { 
  return; // there is no possible crash here, unless you force
}
```

### Resources

With pools we can store an unique specific descriptor, then, direct access by it is own index position.
So we can store every single type of descriptors in each designed pool, with safe query functions:

```cpp
// ekg/io/resources.hpp

#include <array>
#include <functional>

namespace ekg::io {
  extern struct resources_t {
  public:
    ekg::pool<ekg::checkbox_t> checkbox_pool {};
    ekg::pool<ekg::button_t> button_pool {};
  } resources;
}

namespace ekg {
  ekg::checkbox_t &checkbox(ekg::at_t &at) {
    if (at.index >= ekg::resources.checkbox_pool.size()) return;

    ekg::checkbox_t &ref {
      ekg::resources.checkbox_pool.at(at.index)
    };

    return (
      ref.unique_id == at.id
      ?
      ekg::resources.checkbox_pool.at(at.index);
      :
      ekg::checkbox_t::not_found
    );
  }
}
```

Querying descriptors is totally safe.

```cpp
ekg::at_t find_my_checkbox { .id = 0, .index = 64 };
ekg::checkbox_t &checkbox {ekg::checkbox(find_my_checkbox)};

if (checkbox == ekg::checkbox_t::not_found) {
  ekg::log() << "not found :c";
} else {
  ekg::log() << "found :3";
}
```

Generic querying is safe, a necessary MACRO is defined:
```cpp
#define EKG_QUERY_DESCRIPTOR(at) \
  ekg::checkbox &checkbox {ekg::checkbox(at)}; \
  ekg::button_t &button {ekg::button(at)}; \
  /* all descriptors */ \
```

An example of generic-querying use for children property:
```cpp
struct frame_t {
public:
  constexpr static ekg::frame_t not_found {/* reserved behavior-case */};
public:
  std::vector<ekg::at_t> children {};
};

// etc

frame_t &frame {ekg::frame(my_stack, "window")}; // find for a frame tagged with 'window'
if (frame == ekg::frame_t::not_found) {
  return;
}

ekg::button_t &my_button {ekg::make(ekg::button_t { /* properties */ })};
frame.children.push_back(my_button); // added

ekg::checkbox_t &my_check {ekg::make(ekg::checkbox_t { /* properties */ })};
frame.children.push_back(my_check); // added

// etc

ekg::frame_t &descriptor {ekg::frame(this->at_descriptor)};
if (descriptor == ekg::frame_t::not_found) return;
for (ekg::at_t &at : descriptor.children) {
  EKG_QUERY_DESCRIPTOR(at);
  height += child.rect.y + child.rect.h;
}
```

## Conclusion

Now EKG is pool-safety, there is way to leak memory unless you force it.
